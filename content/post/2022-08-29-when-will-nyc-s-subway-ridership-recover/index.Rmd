During the writing of my posts about COVIDs effect on the NYC Subway ridership the New York Times published an article called [*The Pandemic Wasnâ€™t Supposed to Hurt New York Transit This Much*](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/15/nyregion/mta-nyc-budget.html).  In this article there's comment that:

While I have no knowledge of there this 80% target by 2026 comes from, I do have some subway fare data sitting around.  So why not compare the article's data to my own.

The methodology will be similar to what I did in my [initial subway forecasting post](https://jlaw.netlify.app/2022/07/13/how-much-has-covid-cost-the-nyc-subway-system-in-lost-fares/) using the `modeltime` package and the champion Prophet w/ XGBoosted Errors to do the forecasting.

## Libraries
```{r libaries}
### Data Manipulation Packages
library(timetk) # For time series features in recipe
library(tidyverse) # General Data Manipulation
library(scales) # Making prettier scales
library(lubridate) # Dealing with Dates

# Modeling Ecosystem
library(modeltime) # Framework for Time Series models
library(tidymodels) # Framework for general recipie and workflows

### Model Packages
library(prophet) # Algorithm for forecasting

```

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(here)
```

## Data

The data is the same set from my [initial post](post](https://jlaw.netlify.app/2022/07/13/how-much-has-covid-cost-the-nyc-subway-system-in-lost-fares/).  

```{r}
fares <- readRDS(file.path(here(), 'content', 'post', 
                           '2022-07-13-how-much-has-covid-cost-the-nyc-subway-system-in-lost-fares', 
                           'data',
                           'mta_data.RDS')) %>% 
  group_by(week_start) %>% 
  summarize(fares = sum(fares))
```


```{r}
rec <- recipe(fares ~ ., data = fares %>% filter(week_start >= ymd(20200401))) %>%
  step_timeseries_signature(week_start) %>% 
  step_rm(matches("(.iso$)|(am.pm$)|(.xts$)|(hour)|(minute)|(second)|(wday)")) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), one_hot = TRUE)
```

```{r}
prophet_boost_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(
    prophet_boost(seasonality_yearly = TRUE) %>%
      set_engine('prophet_xgboost')
  ) %>% 
  add_recipe(rec) %>%
  fit(fares %>% filter(week_start >= ymd(20200401)) )
```


```{r}
final_fcst <- modeltime_table(
    prophet_boost_wf
  ) %>% 
  modeltime_forecast(
    new_data = tibble(week_start = seq.Date(ymd(20220618), by = "weeks", 
                                            length.out = 52*10)),
    actual_data = fares,
    keep_data = TRUE
  )
```

```{r}
final_fcst %>% 
  plot_modeltime_forecast(.conf_interval_show = T, .interactive = F) + 
  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)
```

## When does fares return to 80%?  To 100%?

```{r}
baseline <- fares %>% 
  filter(month(week_start)==12 & year(week_start) == 2019) %>% 
  summarize(avg_fares = mean(fares)) %>% 
  pull(avg_fares)

recovery <- final_fcst %>% 
  filter(week_start >= ymd(20200401)) %>% 
  mutate(recovery_pct = .value / baseline) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week_start, y = recovery_pct)) + 
    geom_line() + 
    scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)

```
